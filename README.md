# Advanced Statistics - Mixed effects models in R

This page contains the course material for the master lecture of the *Environmental Sciences - Environmental Modelling and Data Sciences* profile. It teaches Mixed Effects models in R, mainly with the lme4, lmer and brms packages. 

The lecture takes place Wednesday mornings from 08:15 - 10:00. For the slides, see lectures folder above.
Exercise take place from 10:15 - 12:00, see exercises folder above.

### Goal

Mixed effects models are powerful tools to deal with structure and heterogeneity in environmental data arising from such common practices as multiple sampling of units, grouping units at various hierarchical levels, or spatial sampling. A rough estimation shows that 80-90% of environmental studies require mixed effects models to analyze their data.

In the module, you will gain a deeper understanding of regression models. You will develop a critical knowledge on how to implement mixed effects models and use them for drawing inference from complex data. In addition to a Maximum Likelihood based approach, a Bayesian perspective will be acquired.

### Prequisites

- Basic statistical knowledge: distributions, maximum likelihood, (multiple) regressions (ANCOVA), analysis of variance (ANOVA), generalized linear and additive models (GLMs, GAMs).

- Data import, handling, and basic statistical analyzes in R (www.r-project.org) using the above tools (lm, glm, gam, aov).

- Knowledge of content of “R for Beginners” (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf).
