\frametitle{Course Aims}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Refreshing your statistic basics
    \item Making you familiar with the philosophy and practice of Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMM) and Generalised Mixed Effects Models (GLMM)
    \item Giving you the basics for building, validating, analysing, and interpreting your own LMMs and GLMMs in R
    \item Excite you about the Bayesian approach
    \item Preparing the ground that will allow you to go further from here: there is \textbf{much} more!
\end{itemize}
